    'about': "I am a principal engineer on MetLife's Global Technology and Operations (GTO) network engineering team, a position which, somewhat to my chagrin, has had me doing more project and people management work than technical work for the last 11 months. I was tasked with getting a project back online after the situation of the last couple of years derailed it. The work is very important to the company. Sometimes you have to roll up your sleeves and do the less glamorous work because it's just part of the job - It can't be all fun all the time. I cut my teeth in network operations before moving into engineering. I enjoyed the fast paced, “putting out fires” nature of operations work; you end up chasing the endorphin rush of the next major issue. I also enjoy the more methodical, focused nature of network engineering and the satisfaction of completing projects and onboarding new technologies. I was'nt actively looking for other opportunities; however, a former colleague thought I may be interested in this position. To be honest, the “expertise” requirement for software development and containers is quite intimidating. Mainly because I am more of a network engineer that is learning to code than a real software developer. I have a notion of containers, and most of my coding experience is Python, PowerShell, and Terraform from when I supported network cloud infrastructure. Nonetheless, I do enjoy getting outside of my comfort zone, taking on new challenges, and learning new things. And as they say, “nothing ventured nothing gained.” If I have learned anything over the years it is this - may not always have the exact required skill set, but the key to success is my ability to adapt and learn."
